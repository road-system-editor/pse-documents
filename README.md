# ![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102614006?s=20&v=4) ROSE PSE documents
[ROSE](https://github.com/road-system-editor/rose) was created as a group
project in the
["Praxis der Softwareentwicklung" (*Software Engineering Practice*)](https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/lehre/WS202122/pse/?lang=en)
course at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
The goal of PSE is to build a useful application using the
[waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model).
This repository contains the documents that we submitted for the
different phases of the project.

Please note that the documents have not been modified since their submission and
will not be updated if ROSE is modified in the future.
Thus, they are only available in German and contain mistakes that have not been
and will not be corrected.

We hope that these documents will be useful as an example for future PSE teams
and that they provide a detailed and clear insight into the purpose and
design and development process of ROSE.

## Contained Documents
1. **Planning**:
[**`Pflichtenheft-ROSE.pdf`**](./Pflichtenheft-ROSE.pdf) describes the goals of
this project through functional and non-functional requirements.
It details the interactions with the system through scenarios, use case diagrams and user interface mockups.
Global test cases and further test methods are specified to determine whether an
implementation meets the expectations for the project.

2. **Design**:
[**`Entwurf-ROSE.pdf`**](./Entwurf-ROSE.pdf) describes the software architecture
of the project. 
The document specifies the object-oriented design of ROSE both through an object
model (class and package diagrams) and through a dynamic model (activity,
sequence and state UML diagrams). 

3. **Implementation**:
[**`Implementierungsbericht-ROSE.pdf`**](./Implementierungsbericht-ROSE.pdf)
describes our approach to implementing the system that we specified in the planning
and design phases.
We depict our schedule through a Gantt chart and describe our peer-review-/ and tool-assisted workflow.
The document also states which requirements have been implemented and what
changes we made to our design.

4. **Testing**:
[**`Qualitaetssicherungsbericht-ROSE.pdf`**](./Qualitaetssicherungsbericht-ROSE.pdf)
lays out our quality assurance process.
In detail, we describe our automated unit tests, GUI tests and code quality test
as well as our supervised user test and survey.
Every bug that has been found in the process is described and analyzed. We also
documented whether and how this bug has been or could be fixed.

5. **Final presentation**:
*No document was submitted for the final presentation.*
